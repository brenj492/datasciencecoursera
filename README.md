This is the repository required for Coursera's Data Scientist's Toolbox course to prove that I have created a GitHub account. By reading this text file, you have proof that I have created an account under the username brenj492 and know how to create a repository. I look forward to learning more about Git and Github through the Data Science Specialization.
